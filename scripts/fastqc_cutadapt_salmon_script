Create  a directory where your reports will be stored
```{bash}

mkdir qualityreports
```
checking quality of the raw reads using fastqc
```{bash}
fastqc -o ./qualityreports *.fastq
```

Trimming adapters from your sequences depending on the quality as assessed from above

```{bash}
mkdir cutadaptresults

for file in *_R2.fastq
do
    
    file2=${file/_R2.fastq/_R1.fastq} # replace _R1.fastq in the file name with _R2.fastq
    out1=./cutadaptresults/${file}
    out2=${out1/_R2.fastq/_R1.fastq}
    cutadapt -m 20 -u  13 -o ${out1} -p ${out2}  ${file} ${file2}
done
```
After trimming do a quality re-check before proceeding to the next steps, 

```{bash}
mkdir quality-re-check
fastqc -o ./quality-re-check ./cutadaptresults/*.fastq
```

Quantification of the reads using salmon quantification tool
```{bash}
mkdir quants
```
salmon  requires an index to do pseudo alignment. The index is made from your reference genome
```{bash}
salmon index -t gencode.v36.transcripts.fa -i salmo_index

```
salmon loop
```{bash}

for file in *_R2.fastq
do  
    samp=${file//_R2.fastq/_R1.fastq}
    echo "Processing ${file}"
    salmon quant -i salmo_index -l A \
         -1 ${file}\
         -2 ${samp}\
         -p 2 --validateMappings -o ./quants/${file//_R2.fastq/} 
done
```
